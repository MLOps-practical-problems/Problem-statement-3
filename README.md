# MLOps Practice Project

## Problem Statement 3: Saving and Reusing a Machine Learning Model

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model, save it, and reuse it without retraining.

### Tasks
- Train a machine learning model.
- Save the trained model.
- Reload and reuse the saved model for predictions.

#### Dataset Used
- Iris Dataset (from sklearn.datasets).
- Features include:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
  - Iris flower class (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

#### Model
- `saved_model.pkl`: Trained model saved using `joblib`.
- `scaler.pkl`: Scalar for data preprocessing saved using `joblib`
